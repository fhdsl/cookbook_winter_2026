Corn and Avocado Salsa
2 cups canned or frozen corn ( I like to use the TJ's frozen sweet corn)
1 jalapeno ( I like to add two if making for myself but for a party just 1)
¼ cup diced red onion
2 Tablespoons of chopped cilantro
2 Tablespoons of fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon of sugar
¼ teaspoon of salt
1 avocado diced

Mix together all ingredients (except avocado) in a bowl until combined. Put in avocado then give one more stir. This taste best if it is given a couple of hours to sit in the fridge after it is made.
