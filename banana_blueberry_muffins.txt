4.8 from 64 reviews
2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour, or a mix of both
(spooned & leveled)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup (230g) mashed banana (about 3 medium or 2 large ripe bananas)
1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar (or coconut sugar)
1/4 cup (85g) honey or pure maple syrup
1/4 cup (56g) coconut oil, melted (or vegetable oil/avocado oil)
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2/3 cup (160ml) milk (dairy or nondairy), at room temperature
1 and 1/4 cups (175g) fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw)
optional: 1 Tablespoon coarse sugar for sprinkling on top
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or
line with cupcake liners. (If you need a recommendation, this muffin pan and this
muffin pan have both held up well with very regular use.) Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt

Notes
In a medium bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Once mashed, whisk in the brown
sugar, honey/maple syrup, coconut oil, egg, vanilla, and milk until combined.
3
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until everything is just
combined. Fold in the blueberries. Expect a semi-thick batter. Spoon the batter
evenly into the muffin cups, filling them all the way to the top.
4
Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F (218°C); then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce
heat to 350°F (177°C) and continue baking for another 15–18 minutes or until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take
in the oven is about 20–23 minutes, give or take. (For mini or jumbo muffins, see
Notes for baking instructions.)
5
Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, and then transfer to a wire
rack to continue cooling.
6
Muffins stay fresh covered at room temperature for a few days, or in the refrigerator
for up to 1 week.
7
Freezing Instructions: For longer storage, freeze the muffins in a freezer-friendly
container or bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then warm
up in the microwave if desired.

Why the initial high oven temperature? Like I recommend for most muffin recipes,
bake the muffins for 5 minutes at a very hot temperature. Then, keeping the muffins
in the oven, switch to a lower temperature for the remaining bake time. This initial
high temperature will quickly lift the muffin tops so they’re extra high, then the
centers will bake during the lower temperature bake time. This trick makes beautiful
bakery-style muffins every time.

4 Milk: You can use any milk, dairy or nondairy.
For a jumbo muffin pan: 425°F for 5 minutes, then reduce to 350°F for 22–25
minutes for a total of 27–30 minutes. Makes about 6. For mini muffins: 350°F
(whole time) for 12–14 minutes. Makes about 36–40.

Loaf Pan: I haven’t personally tested it this recipe as a loaf, but the volume of batter
is enough for a 9×5-inch loaf pan. I’m unsure of the best bake time, but you can
follow this zucchini bread recipe as a guide.

Updated in 2023: I made a couple small updates to the recipe, so the muffins are
more moist and flavorful. To make the old version, leave out the baking powder,
vanilla, and coconut oil. Add 1/4 cup (60g) Greek yogurt and another 1/2 cup (about
