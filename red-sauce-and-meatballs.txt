#Collins Family Red Sauce

Ingredients:
4 Sweet Onions (baseball sized)
4 Large cans crushed tomatoes
1 small can tomato paste
1 Large can whole tomatoes
1 or 2 large pork chops with bone
4 cloves garlic
Red wine (cheap cabernet)
2 tbsp Parsley flakes
1 tbsp Oregano flakes
Salt
Olive oil

Meatballs
1/2 cup Shaker cheese
1 lb ground beef
1/2 lb ground pork
Italian breadcrumbs (until sticky)
2 eggs

Directions:

Sauce
Chop onions and garlic and add to wide, large pot. Cover with oil and salt generously.
Sweat onions on med/high heat (~15-20 mins) stirring occasionally until they are see through. Longer the better, but do not let brown
Add all tomatoes (paste, crushed, whole), oregano and parsley (more parsley than oregano, but do to taste). Smash with a potato masher to crush whole tomatoes.
Rinse tomato cans with 1 can of water and add to sauce. Bring to a boil
Add about 1 glass of red wine and pork chops. Continue to simmer at least 1 hour- longer the better- until pork falls apart. Add more water (or beer/wine) if it gets too thick.

Meatballs
Combine shaker cheese, ground beef, ground pork, and eggs. Add breadcrumbs until sticky (add water if too sticky) and form into balls
Add to sauce once it returns to a simmer and cook in the sauce at least 2-3 hours
