#Cranberry Curd Tart

Ingredients

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

The Crust
•	⅓ cup slivered almonds
•	2½ tablespoons sugar
•	1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
•	¾ cup all-purpose flour, plus additional for rolling
•	½ teaspoon kosher salt
•	6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
•	1 egg yolk
•	1 tablespoon water
•	¼ teaspoon almond extract

For the Cranberry Curd
•	12 ounces/340 grams cranberries
•	1 cup/225 grams sugar
•	Peel (orange part only) and juice of 1 orange (about ½ cup)
•	4 ounces/113 grams softened butter (1 stick)
•	2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks

Step 1
To make the crust, place the almonds, sugar and zest in a food processor and process until ground. Add the flour and salt and pulse just to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk together the egg yolk, water and almond extract. Add to the flour mixture and process just until the mixture starts to come together. Press into a bowl, flatten, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Step 2
Press dough evenly into a 10-inch tart pan; use half the dough for the sides and half for the bottom. Prick bottom with a fork and freeze for 30 minutes (or several days if desired).

Step 3
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 25 minutes. Cool.

Step 4
While the crust bakes and cools, make the cranberry curd: Put cranberries, sugar and orange juice and peel in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until cranberries have popped and softened, about 10 minutes. Purée the cooked cranberry and orange mixture with an immersion blender. Press through a fine-mesh sieve. Whisk the butter into the warm liquid.

Step 5
Put eggs and egg yolks into a bowl and beat lightly. Slowly whisk a cup of warm cranberry liquid into the eggs to temper, then combine both and whisk together. Wipe out pot if necessary, return liquid to pot and cook over low heat until nearly bubbling and thickened, about 10 minutes. If using immediately, let cool to room temperature. If working ahead, cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap (press wrap against curd) and refrigerate. (Curd may be cooked up to 1 day ahead.)

Step 6
Pour cooled cranberry curd into the cooled prebaked tart shell and smooth top with a spatula. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes to set curd. Cool on a rack. Store at room temperature for up to 2 days.
